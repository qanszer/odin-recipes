# Odin Project: Recipes

## What is this?

This is a basic html recipe website instructed by Odin wherein it contains a homepage and links to various recipe pages. 

A recipe page includes a recipe title, corresponding image, caption for the image, recipe description, ingredients, and steps. It also contains links both to go back to the homepage, as well as to return to the top of the current page.

## Concepts Used

 * HTML Boilerplate
 * Semantic HTML (`<strong>`, `<em>`,`<h1>`, etc.)
 * Hyperlinks/Anchor tags (`<a>` with `href="..."`)
 * Image tags (`<img>` with `src="..."`)
 * Git and GitHub
 * Detailed commits
 * Lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`)
